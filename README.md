# Didi Berman â€” AI, Automation & MLOps Engineer

Hi! Iâ€™m Didi, a developer passionate about building real-world solutions at the intersection of automation, AI, and MLOps/DevOps. My GitHub is a living portfolio of projects that blend practical engineering, end-to-end machine learning workflows, and a commitment to learning in public and sharing knowledge.

Alongside my technical work, I bring a deep commitment to inner work and human development. 

I'm a dedicated Vipassana meditator and currently training in Collective Trauma Healing Facilitation â€” aiming to bridge rigorous engineering with high emotional intelligence and trauma-informed awareness.
