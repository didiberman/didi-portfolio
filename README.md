# Didi Berman â€” AI, Automation & MLOps Engineer

Welcome! Iâ€™m Didi Berman, a developer passionate about building real-world solutions at the intersection of automation, AI, and MLOps/DevOps. My GitHub is a living portfolio of projects that blend practical engineering, end-to-end machine learning workflows, and a commitment to learning in public and sharing knowledge.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Core Strengths

- **End-to-End MLOps:**  
  Designing, training, and deploying machine learning models with modern, production-ready pipelines. Skilled in model fine-tuning, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and cloud/Kubernetes deployments.

- **Deep Learning (PyTorch):**  
  Proficient in using PyTorch for model development and training, including transformer-based architectures for NLP.

- **Automation & Workflow Engineering:**  
  Building tools and agents that automate business processes (lead generation, content transformation, outreach) using AI and workflow orchestration platforms like n8n.

- **Full-Stack & API Development:**  
  Creating robust APIs and user-facing applications using TypeScript, Python, React, Vite, Tailwind, and mobile frameworks.

- **Security & Systems Insight:**  
  Experience with low-level networking and security tooling. Capable of building educational tools that demystify complex concepts for others.

- **Learning in Public:**  
  Developing resources and curricula to help myself and others master advanced technical domains, especially MLOps.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### [youtube-comment-classifier-mlops](https://github.com/didiberman/youtube-comment-classifier-mlops)
A complete MLOps portfolio project. Fine-tunes a DistilBERT transformer (using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch) to classify YouTube comments into emotional categories, then deploys it as a real-time FastAPI service.

**Demonstrates:**  
- Hugging Face/PyTorch model fine-tuning  
- Modular FastAPI inference API  
- Fully Dockerized pipeline (training, serving, deployment)  
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions  
- Cloud/Kubernetes readiness (AWS, GCP, K3s)  
- Data labeling, preprocessing, and experiment tracking (MLflow/W&B roadmap)
